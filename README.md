## **🌱 Inspiration** 
---

India produces over **60 million tons of domestic waste annually**, but **only 10% is properly treated**—the rest ends up in **landfills**, worsening pollution. One of the most **underutilized waste categories is fabric**, which remains **unrecycled in India** while major global brands like **H&M** already incorporate textile recycling.  

We realized that **waste producers (households & businesses)** could be **incentivized** to manage their waste **properly** if given financial motivation. This led to **WasteBuddy**, an **AI-driven solution** that helps people **segregate, recycle, and trade waste responsibly**, contributing to a **circular economy and a cleaner environment**.
